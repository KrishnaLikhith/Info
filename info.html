                <p align="justify">Hi Everybody, I am Krishna Likhith. I am 11 years old and I live in Bangalore. I have created this emergency web app to help people who suddenly need an ambulance, or go to the hospital or call a fire station. This has the ability to show
                    the hospitals, police station or fire stations that are near to you in the map. I have made this app to help people who are in emergency to go to the hospital or call an ambulance if there is any health problem and also to call the
                    fire station when there is a fire. You can also find nearby schools, restaurants and Shopping Malls. This App also gives information about bus stands, railway stations, airport and auto-rickshaw.</p>
